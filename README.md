# ITLP-Final-Project-Hardware-Page
This is the final project i did in my last year of  the high school. Basically i designed a web page for the a imaginary company what they sell hardware compoenentÂ´s. The code has been integret with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and a data base made in SQL.  Further this project is attach to a report, that is like a project guide and it has information about the function of the  backend of the page.
In this project was the first time i used JS, PHP and SQL. From the school they requested us to make a web page what integret every what we see during our last year in a final integreter project. If you download the repository you notice how there are 2 ".docx", thats is the guide what i have mean to you earlyer.
How i commented you, this is my first time i used some languages like PHP, JS and SQL, and also my first time what i do a project integreter complete by self. And yes although I received the orientation and help of my teachers, witch would the entery design and functionality of my page was made by me only.
for that i lied if i tell you what i made this page by myself.
To the end, the reason waht i uploaded this uncomplete and amateur project is beacause want to see, in few years, how much I have improved. 
So don't be so critical :D
